Opinion(s) for cases from the October 2024 Term will be released beginning at 10:00 EDT. If more than one opinion is released, there will be a 5-10 minute pause between each. 

Frequently Asked Questions:

* How many cases remain from the October 2024 Term?
   * We expect roughly 21 more opinions (as of the writing of this post). 
* How many opinions will be released today?
   * At least one. Traditionally, the Supreme Court finishes their term by June 30th - so the odds of releasing multiple opinions today is high. 
* Is there a livestream?
   * No, though the Supreme Court Press Corps did recently request that Chief Justice Roberts authorize livestreams of opinions. 
* Where can I see the list of remaining cases for this term?
   * [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_pending_United_States_Supreme_Court_cases) has a list, as does [Oyez](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2024).

The warmongers were wrong about Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya. Now watch them make the same mistake about Iran

Owen Jones

Wed 18 Jun 2025 13.00 CEST

Israel is the main source of terror and instability in the Middle East. But the west continually turns away from this reality

As the G7 issues a statement declaring that Israel has a “right to defend itself”, you have a right to ask if you are losing your mind. Israel launched an unprovoked onslaught on Iran. Its excuse – that Tehran may acquire a nuclear weapon – renders its attack illegal under the UN charter, which forbids wars justified by the claim of a future threat.

“Iran is the principal source of regional instability and terror,” declares the G7 statement. Even though Donald Trump’s intelligence chief testified three months ago that the US intelligence community “continues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon”. Even though it’s Israel that actually possesses nuclear weapons, while refusing to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and refusing International Atomic Energy Agency inspections. Even though, as progress was being made in nuclear talks between Iran and the US, Israel targeted Iran’s chief negotiator and proceeded to exterminate scientists, including their families, alongside countless other civilians, including children, an athlete, a teacher, a pilates instructor. Even though Israel’s leader is subject to an arrest warrant, accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity. And even though Israel has erased Gaza in a genocidal frenzy, and subjected the illegally occupied and colonised West Bank to an escalating pogrom, attacked southern Lebanon and Beirut, and invaded and occupied Syria. No country in the Middle East is as great a source of regional instability and terror as Israel: it’s not even close.

Yet even as polling shows that Britons overwhelmingly want no part in this literal crime, we hear the same tunes sung to demonise opponents of the latest carnage. Scottish politicians demanding peace “are siding with a mediaeval theocratic dictatorship”, declares former flagship BBC interviewer Andrew Neil. Recall how opponents of the Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya calamities were monstered as lackeys of Saddam Hussein, the Taliban and Muammar Gaddafi. Yet who, Mr Neil, was vindicated – catastrophically so?

Here is a tragedy paid with the blood of an estimated more than 4.5 million human souls – the combined number of direct and indirect deaths in the post-9/11 war zones, according to a Brown University study. There have been no reputational consequences for those who cheered on each calamity, allowing them to walk away whistling from each crime scene demanding yet more violence without shame. About six months before the Iraq invasion, and believing the war in Afghanistan to already be a great success, Neil wrote a column warning “the suburbs of Baghdad are now dotted with secret installations, often posing as hospitals or schools” which were developing chemical and biological weapons and, “most sinister of all, a renewed attempt to develop nuclear weapons”.

One sentence he deployed against advocates of peace should surely become the epitaph of the warmongers: “It is unclear how many more times they have to be wrong before we are released from the obligation to take them too seriously.” Benjamin Netanyahu, of course, shared his hubris, promising US Congress in 2002: “If you take out Saddam – Saddam’s regime – I guarantee you that it will have enormous positive reverberations on the region.”

No amount of objective failure can change their minds. This fanaticism can only be sustained by mocking reality itself. Unlike Israel, the Iranian regime “targets civilians”, says a prime minister accused of war crimes. At the same time, an Israeli military spokesperson brands Tehran a “terror regime” because of these killings. The concept of terrorism, in practice, has come to mean violence perpetrated by regimes and militants hostile to the west, used to portray such acts as illegitimate and immoral, unlike the vastly more lethal missiles and bullets of Tel Aviv and Washington.

Israel’s gall is something to behold. It has butchered tens of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza – mostly women and children – yet 24 Israelis killed by Iranian attacks apparently exposes the unique evil of Tehran’s regime. More than twice as many hungry Palestinians looking for food in Gaza were slaughtered in a single massacre by Israeli troops overnight: note how this mass killing receives the tiniest fraction of media attention. There is no attempt to disguise this hierarchy of death. A comprehensive new report on the BBC’s reporting of the Gaza genocide finds that each Israeli fatality received 33 times more coverage than each Palestinian. The west’s facilitation of Israel’s atrocities relies on treating Arab and Iranian lives as worthless.

Iran, too, of course, has a legal responsibility to avoid killing Israeli civilians. As Kenneth Roth, former Human Rights Watch director, observes: “Israel’s close intermingling of military and civilian sites makes it difficult to know what Iran is aiming its missiles at.” In Gaza, this was defined as using civilians as “human shields”, but no such standards are applied to Israel. This narrative was used to wipe Gaza from the face of the Earth, even as Israel used actual Palestinian human shields on an industrial scale.

You may indeed feel like you are losing your mind. After all, Israel’s military has reportedly committed every war crime under the sun. It attacked Iran without evidence or provocation. The same cheerleaders for past bloodbaths strut around advocating yet more slaughter as though recent history never happened, while opponents of dropping bombs on terrified civilians are once more smeared as dangerous extremists. Yet western states issue a statement portraying the genocidal, expansionist, nuclear-armed Israeli state as the victim, and our government refuses to rule out military support for Tel Aviv.

The truth is you are not losing your mind. The actual mad men are those in power. And unless they finally face a reckoning, the abyss awaits.

Israel is the main source of terror and instability in the Middle East. But the west continually turns away from this reality

As the G7 issues a statement declaring that Israel has a “right to defend itself”, you have a right to ask if you are losing your mind. Israel launched an unprovoked onslaught on Iran. Its excuse – that Tehran may acquire a nuclear weapon – renders its attack illegal under the UN charter, which forbids wars justified by the claim of a future threat.

“Iran is the principal source of regional instability and terror,” declares the G7 statement. Even though Donald Trump’s intelligence chief testified three months ago that the US intelligence community “continues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon”. Even though it’s Israel that actually possesses nuclear weapons, while refusing to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and refusing International Atomic Energy Agency inspections. Even though, as progress was being made in nuclear talks between Iran and the US, Israel targeted Iran’s chief negotiator and proceeded to exterminate scientists, including their families, alongside countless other civilians, including children, an athlete, a teacher, a pilates instructor. Even though Israel’s leader is subject to an arrest warrant, accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity. And even though Israel has erased Gaza in a genocidal frenzy, and subjected the illegally occupied and colonised West Bank to an escalating pogrom, attacked southern Lebanon and Beirut, and invaded and occupied Syria. No country in the Middle East is as great a source of regional instability and terror as Israel: it’s not even close.

Yet even as polling shows that Britons overwhelmingly want no part in this literal crime, we hear the same tunes sung to demonise opponents of the latest carnage. Scottish politicians demanding peace “are siding with a mediaeval theocratic dictatorship”, declares former flagship BBC interviewer Andrew Neil. Recall how opponents of the Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya calamities were monstered as lackeys of Saddam Hussein, the Taliban and Muammar Gaddafi. Yet who, Mr Neil, was vindicated – catastrophically so?

Here is a tragedy paid with the blood of an estimated more than 4.5 million human souls – the combined number of direct and indirect deaths in the post-9/11 war zones, according to a Brown University study. There have been no reputational consequences for those who cheered on each calamity, allowing them to walk away whistling from each crime scene demanding yet more violence without shame. About six months before the Iraq invasion, and believing the war in Afghanistan to already be a great success, Neil wrote a column warning “the suburbs of Baghdad are now dotted with secret installations, often posing as hospitals or schools” which were developing chemical and biological weapons and, “most sinister of all, a renewed attempt to develop nuclear weapons”.

One sentence he deployed against advocates of peace should surely become the epitaph of the warmongers: “It is unclear how many more times they have to be wrong before we are released from the obligation to take them too seriously.” Benjamin Netanyahu, of course, shared his hubris, promising US Congress in 2002: “If you take out Saddam – Saddam’s regime – I guarantee you that it will have enormous positive reverberations on the region.”

No amount of objective failure can change their minds. This fanaticism can only be sustained by mocking reality itself. Unlike Israel, the Iranian regime “targets civilians”, says a prime minister accused of war crimes. At the same time, an Israeli military spokesperson brands Tehran a “terror regime” because of these killings. The concept of terrorism, in practice, has come to mean violence perpetrated by regimes and militants hostile to the west, used to portray such acts as illegitimate and immoral, unlike the vastly more lethal missiles and bullets of Tel Aviv and Washington.

Israel’s gall is something to behold. It has butchered tens of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza – mostly women and children – yet 24 Israelis killed by Iranian attacks apparently exposes the unique evil of Tehran’s regime. More than twice as many hungry Palestinians looking for food in Gaza were slaughtered in a single massacre by Israeli troops overnight: note how this mass killing receives the tiniest fraction of media attention. There is no attempt to disguise this hierarchy of death. A comprehensive new report on the BBC’s reporting of the Gaza genocide finds that each Israeli fatality received 33 times more coverage than each Palestinian. The west’s facilitation of Israel’s atrocities relies on treating Arab and Iranian lives as worthless.

Iran, too, of course, has a legal responsibility to avoid killing Israeli civilians. As Kenneth Roth, former Human Rights Watch director, observes: “Israel’s close intermingling of military and civilian sites makes it difficult to know what Iran is aiming its missiles at.” In Gaza, this was defined as using civilians as “human shields”, but no such standards are applied to Israel. This narrative was used to wipe Gaza from the face of the Earth, even as Israel used actual Palestinian human shields on an industrial scale.

You may indeed feel like you are losing your mind. After all, Israel’s military has reportedly committed every war crime under the sun. It attacked Iran without evidence or provocation. The same cheerleaders for past bloodbaths strut around advocating yet more slaughter as though recent history never happened, while opponents of dropping bombs on terrified civilians are once more smeared as dangerous extremists. Yet western states issue a statement portraying the genocidal, expansionist, nuclear-armed Israeli state as the victim, and our government refuses to rule out military support for Tel Aviv.

The truth is you are not losing your mind. The actual mad men are those in power. And unless they finally face a reckoning, the abyss awaits.

But The Israel today is NOT the Israel the Bible is referring to. Becaus remember, today's Israel & its country is less than 100 yrs old. It was given to the Jews in 1944? As a type of reparation to the Jews for having to endure the Holocaust. So for all the religious people out there that are freaking out about us no longer being allied with Israel. You need not worry because biblical Israel (well, we hope)  is not even in the same location. Obviously we all have google & you do more research if you choose. I'd advise everyone to do that.

1lf2g99,"The land of Israel was NOT promised to THEM 3,000 years ago. The people acting like they are ""Chosen by God"" are not really who were chosen by God.","I’ve been studying what “Israel” truly means and it’s not what they've been trying to make everyone believe.

Israel was a person: Jacob, the son of Isaac and Rebekah, and grandson of Abraham and Sarai. Jacob was given the name Isra’el, and his twelve sons became the founders of the Twelve Tribes of Israel (Bani Isra’el). Their descendants (the original Israelites) followed Moses from Egypt to the land we now call Palestine, which was given to them by God.

I started to logic out that perhaps many of the people who lived in Palestine before 1948, would have been either Muslim, Christian, or Jewish and they were likely to have been descendants of those original Israelites. But then after 1948, when Jews from outside Palestine started migrating in from Europe and elsewhere, especially Ashkenazi Jews (which make up most of Israel's Jews, have less direct genetic or ancestral connection to Bani Isra’el than the indigenous peoples of Palestine.

1leqix2,Am I selfish in asking my Hindu bf to not introduce caste to our children (Interfaith couple),"_DISCLAIMER: THIS IS A POST FOR A COUPLE IN NEED PF ADVICE NOT FOR YOU TO SPEW COMMUNAL HATRED; MOVE ON IF THATS YOUR AGENDA_

Hi all! Please be patient and hear me out. I am here to seek perspective and am open to opinions. I am Christian and my boyfriend is Hindu and older to me. His caste is Rajput and he is from Udaipur. I am from a hill state. My partner loves me a lot and so do I, we know being an interfaith couple means mostly agreeing on finding a middle ground. 

We have already settled that children will be exposed to both faiths and traditions with much emphasis on humanistic values and goodwill and free will to choose later in life what they want to believe in. We are about to engage in marriage talks and I know my boyfriend, especially being from Rajasthan, has Rajput ingrained in his identity. I have always learned from people's true life experiences how casteism can be. I told my bf that I do not want to introduce are children to caste or affiliate them to any caste.

Yes they will know about their lineage of Rajput kings and that their father is Rajput and so are their dadas and nanis...but they wont be told that their caste is Rajput as I do not want them to have a sense of false pride, as an unemployed woman told me ""I dont wanna sound castiest but we arent even Hindus, we are Rajputs."" I just don't want them to be affiliated to any caste even if they choose to become Hindus. 

My conversation regarding this was kinda rocky with my bf but he said this, ""I want to tell them that they are half Rajput and their mom is Christian who doesn't have a caste, I will also tell them that being Rajput is nothing to feel superior about or think u are better than any other caste that come under Hinduism. This is a part of your identity and thats personal to you and if anybody asks, you first ask them why are they interested in knowing your caste and then share. All castes are equal.""

He also told me that he'll also tell children about the bad side of caste system and what lower castes have experienced (it breaks my heart to still see that happen). 

I still feel slightly unsettled with the idea of my children having a caste affiliation even if its partial... please give me constructive perspectives.

---

**Timeline Summary**

* **June 7, 2025 (Night):**
  Veeru Jatav was murdered at his home in Kherli, Alwar. His wife Anita allegedly let in her lover Kashiram and four hired killers, who then strangled Veeru to death while the couple’s 9-year-old son silently witnessed the crime.

* **June 8, 2025:**
  Anita called her sister-in-law and claimed that Veeru had suddenly fallen ill. However, Veeru’s elder brother Gabbar became suspicious of the vague explanation.

* **June 8-9, 2025:**
  The 9 yr old son courageously narrated the entire sequence of events to the police. His detailed account identified the assailants and contradicted Anita’s version of events.

* **Following Days (June 9-17, 2025):**
  Police launched a formal investigation, scanned over 100 CCTV recordings, collected call data records, and confirmed through post-mortem that the cause of death was strangulation.

**Key Takeaways**

* The **child’s testimony** cracked the case and matched CCTV evidence
* Highlights the importance of **thorough police work** (CCTV, post-mortem, digital evidence)
* **Murder was premeditated**, planned for romantic and possibly financial motives
* **Anita’s silence during the killing** and her later false claims of illness played a role in early deception
* This case reflects a **disturbing** pattern seen in 2025 - **12+ media reported incidents** where wives, along with lovers have plotted their husbands' murders (across India).
* Such incidents raise serious concerns about the **mental health and trauma of children caught in domestic crimes**. Proper psychological support and long term care must be prioritized for child witnesses like the 9 yr old in this case.

The corruption, the communalism, the polarisation. But we rarely stop to ask a simple, powerful question, What if we actually stayed united? What if we stopped letting every difference, religion, caste, language, politics, become a battlefield, and instead started building something together?

Let’s imagine that for a moment. A truly united India wouldn’t just be more peaceful,  it would be unstoppable. Think about it, Bengal’s intellectual capital, Punjab’s resilience, Kerala’s education, Tamil Nadu’s innovation, the entrepreneurial drive of Gujarat and Maharashtra, all working in sync, not in silos. That kind of collective strength could reshape not just our country, but the world.

The truth is, internal harmony isn’t just an emotional ideal, it’s an economic and strategic necessity. Riots, communal tensions, and hate politics don’t just divide people, they wreck businesses, disrupt infrastructure, slow education and drain our resources. Every time we burn a bus over religion or a temple mosque issue, we’re not just hurting the other side. We’re setting ourselves back by decades.

And let’s not be naive, there are global powers watching, even betting, that India will continue to eat itself from within. A fragmented India is easy to manipulate. A united one? Not so much. So unity isn’t just morality,  it’s national security.

More importantly, our diversity isn’t a liability. It’s our deepest strength. India is not a melting pot that forces sameness , it’s a thali, where each region, each identity keeps its flavor, yet contributes to the meal. The goal isn’t to erase differences, but to align them toward a common future. That’s what real unity looks like, not uniformity, but harmony.

Sadly, most divisions in India don’t benefit the average citizen. They benefit power hungry politicians, social media grifters, and those who thrive on chaos. Every time we fight each other, the price is paid by the common man, in jobs lost, schools shut, trust broken. Ask yourself honestly, Who profits from us being divided? Because it’s not the people.

Yes, we have historical wounds. Partition. Caste trauma. Religious violence. But if we keep living in those wounds, we’ll never heal. Unity is the only way we move forward, not by forgetting the past, but by refusing to be trapped in it.

So maybe unity sounds idealistic. But it’s also the most realistic survival strategy we have. We either learn to live together with dignity, or we’ll keep collapsing under the weight of our own mistrust.","https://external-preview.redd.it/IWSoXV7V7jyFqVW_i7rBF6rwBxJVzDY7Ha8lv4kPlPE.png?width=140&height=140&crop=140:140,smart&auto=webp&s=c259951987e0f7af77c7ff83c45877be97e6d578",i.redd.it,2025-06-19 13:14:07.336532
